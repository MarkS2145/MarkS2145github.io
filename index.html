      <p>This page is to help me develop my coding skills as well as engage with others in the coding world.</p>
      <p>I enjoy many activities and have varied interests. Solving problems and working to help others, with theirs, resonates with me. With coding I often find that I loose track of time as I am fully engrossed in my work and the results I achieve. The days fly by and I like that feeling, a lot.</p>
      <h3>Coding Experience</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><h4>JavaScript, HTML and CSS</h4>Currently enrolled in a General Assembly training course and having lots of fun learning</li>
      <li><h4>C#</h4>2 year course at UCLA</li>
      <li><h4>C</h4>Experience in embedded C for Microchip controllers. Experience with C running from a batch file on a PC to perform large scale data regression including data message parsing, processing for statistics, output formatting for presentation layer and summary reports</li>
      <li><h4>Visual basic</h4>Experience programming stand alone desktop apps to improve consistency of data processing and Excel macros</li>
