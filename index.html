      Git Workflow:  https://git.generalassemb.ly/john-deere-sei-7/git-workflow
        - Cloning is a local operation (Command Line)
        - Forking & pulling is an operation on the github server (Browser)
      
      Need to slack each other our repo: https://github.com/MarkStuebs/my_first_repo
      My Name: MarkStuebs
      
      Click settings then collaborators menu
        - Enter password
      
      Then add the Collaborator user name, click Add Collaborators
      
      
      On Git Hub you can fork a repository by clicking the fork on the right hand side of the top menu
      
      Git Hub Fork push pull clone example
      
      Copy URL from your github fork
      
      From terminal, navigate to the parent folder where you want the clone to appear inside of.
      
      From the command line, type:
      Git clone https://github.com/MarkStuebs/my-first-repository
      
      https://github.com/MarkStuebs/my-first-repository.git
      
      Then can ls to check that we have the folder and inside of the folder, using cd <folderName>
      We can see the files.
      
      Git remote -v  // will check if the origin is correct:
        WDXMS80723VCG:my-first-repository Mark$ git remote -v
        origin	https://github.com/MarkStuebs/my-first-repository (fetch)
        origin	https://github.com/MarkStuebs/my-first-repository (push)
      
      
      <make some changes>
      
      To push your changes up to my Github we simply do a git push
      
      Git push -u origin master
      
      WDXMS80723VCG:my-first-repository Mark$ git push

      <p>This page is to help me develop my coding skills as well as engage with others in the coding world.</p>
      <p>I enjoy many activities and have varied interests. Solving problems and working to help others, with theirs, resonates with me. With coding I often find that I loose track of time as I am fully engrossed in my work and the results I achieve. The days fly by and I like that feeling, a lot.</p>
